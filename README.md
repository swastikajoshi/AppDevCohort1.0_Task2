A flutter application : UniFIND that lists all the universities for every valid input as a country name. The key goal is to make the app easy for users to navigate and quickly fetch the related information using an API. When the user types in a parameter (i.e. country name) and hits the submit button, the app swiftly displays the fetched data i.e. the list of universities for that specific country in a user-friendly list view format.
